# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

I used data analysis, machine learning, and cloud computing expertise to develop and implement a credit card fraud detection system. I employed various tools and techniques, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms, to build accurate and reliable machine learning models.

In the data preparation phase, I used SQL to query the dataset and filter out irrelevant or duplicate information. Then, I used Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy to clean and transform the data into a format suitable for modeling. This involved filling in missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

I leveraged cloud computing services like AWS and Google Cloud Platform to ensure efficient and scalable processing. I stored the dataset in cloud-based storage, such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage, and used services like Amazon EMR or Google Cloud Dataproc to run distributed computing jobs on the data.

For real-time data processing, I used tools like Kafka and Spark Streaming. These technologies allowed the system to process incoming data streams and quickly detect and prevent fraudulent transactions.

In the accuracy improvement phase, I used cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models. This involved splitting the dataset into training and validation sets and running the model on different subsets to assess its performance. I also used hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's parameters, such as the number of trees in a Random Forest model or the learning rate in a Gradient Boosting model.

By fine-tuning the machine learning models using these techniques, I achieved high precision and recall in detecting credit card fraud, making the system effective in preventing financial losses for businesses and consumers.
